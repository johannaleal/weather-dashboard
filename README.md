# weather-dashboard

## Description

In this project, I built a weather dashboard that runs in a browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. A user can enter multiple cities to see their weather outlooks.

## Functionality

* The user will enter a city name in a search bar.
* The current date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index will display for the city in a main panel.
* A 5-day forecast of the city will display under the main panel with temperature, humidity, and a weather icon.
* Each city searched will be saved in local storage. The cities searched for will diplay in a menu on the left-hand side of the page.
* Each city name can be clicked to display the city's current weather and 5-day forecast.
